# SNAP Workshop - Computational Linguistics

- **Part 1. Introduction to Google Colab**
  - Colab Notebook: Text Cells
  - Colab Notebook: Code Cells
    - It's tradition: Hello World
    - comments versus code versus text cells

- **Part 2. Starting with Python and Text**
  - Save text to a variable
  - Print text from a variable
  - Operate on text as a variable
    - len()
    - print each item of a text variable
    - what do you notice? letters, white space, and punctuation all counted as separate entities
    - delimiters and dealing with quotes in text (e.g., if a word has an apostrophe)
    - more things: .upper(), .lower(), .title(), .strip(), .lstrip(), .rstrip()
      - 
    - goofy stuff, min(), max(), and * with strings. Further unpack how text is being represented
    - for reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-methods/


- **Part 3. Tokenizing and Splitting**
  - string.split()
  - importing NLTK
  - nltk.word_tokenize()
  - using len() to count number of words and/or sentences
  - looping and list comprehension(?)

- **Part 4. Frequency and lexical diversity**
  - set() and len() to calculate lexical diversity
  - importing nltk
  - nltk.FreqDist

- **Part 5. Sentiment Analysis**
- **Part 6. Input and Output of Text data**
  - I feel like this is the place where things can go south...?
