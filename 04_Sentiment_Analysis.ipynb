        "\n",
        "Sentiment analysis is one of those topics which I think can spark a lot of interest. You may have heard of it before. In its most basic form, sentiment analysis tries to measure the overall positivity and negativity from the tone of a text, with the idea that you are able to capture the opinion and/or mood of the author(s). You might also see this referred to as valence or polarity. The classic examples of sentiment analysis usually discuss how one can use sentiment analysis to detect overall negative versus positive tone in movie or product reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "A lot of sentiment analysis libraries are rule-based, which means that the creator of the resources has spent time trying to program the best set of rules to analyse language for these features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Where does sentiment come from? In many cases the sentiment ratings are obtained from human perceptions of how positive or negative individual words are in isolation. These lexicons or wordlists will include high frequency content words (in particular adjectives, which should make sense), and store them in a manner where each word has a \"score\" indicating how positive or negative it is. These scores differ in how they are done - for instance someone could rate a word from 0 to 1, with 0 being the most negative and 1 being the most positive. Or one could use a Likert scale from 1-7, or one could gather votes for whether a word is negative or positive from a variety of people and then let the feature with the most votes \"win.\" The point is, there have been a lot of approaches to capturing these perceptions.\n",

The author of VADER incorporated information from a variety of prior sentiment dictionaries, and then also thought about features such as capitalization, emoticons, non-standard words, and a variety of other ways that people actually use language.\n",
