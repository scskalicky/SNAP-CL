# What is a Google Colab Notebook?

- Jupyter Notebooks
    - Combined text + code
    - Create reports, interactive documents, etc
    - A series of “cells” in a notebook

- Text Cells
    - cells which allow markdown format text, images, etc.

- Code Cells
    - cells which run code (i.e., Python)

- Output Cells
    - Temporary cells which produce output from a code cell

- Colab Notebooks
    - A special type of Jupyter notebook
    - Python is pre-installed
    - Many libraries and dependencies pre-installed
    - Connects to Google Drive (can be useful for file input/output)


# Text Cells

- Text Cells include text in markdown format, allowing for you to include traditional writing separated from the code cells. 
- Markdown has an easy to learn syntax for formatting text - [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- (This document was written using markdown!)

# Code Cells

- Code cells have two primary inputs:
    - code
    - comments (indicated as anything preceded by a #)

- Click the "play" button to run code cells:

A code cell waiting to be run:

# Clearing Code Cells

- Sometimes the output of a code cell can get quite long. One quick solution is that you can click the "x" to clear the output.
